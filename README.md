Boost.Process
=============

The existing Boost.Process project forked to be compatible with the latest Boost 1.56.0.

## Installation

Installation is the same as installing and using the Boost.Process.

- Get the files (clone, download as ZIP, ...)
- Extract inside your main `boost` folder

Boost.Process is mainly just a header-based library, so **that is all** you need to do.
